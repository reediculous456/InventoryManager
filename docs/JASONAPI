For our JSON API Schema we will have the ability to reach out via rest endpoint and get a list of items in inventory with who it's assigned to.
The JSON object will have these fields:
  •  {unique_id: string} required
  •  {object_name: string} required
  •  {assigned_to: string}
  •  {location: string} 
  •  {description: string}
  •  {last_updated: DateTime}

This will allow our users to be able to get data about the object, and search for objects containing specific information.
